--- Day 6: ** Probably a Fire Hazard ---
Because your neighbors keep defeating you in the holiday house decorating contest year after year, you've decided to deploy one million lights in a
1000x1000 grid
.**
Furthermore, because you've been especially nice this year, Santa has mailed you instructions on how to display the ideal lighting configuration.**
Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; the lights at each corner are at
0,0
,
0,999
,
999,999
, and
999,0
.** The instructions include whether to
turn on
,
turn off
, or
toggle
various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs.**  Each coordinate pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair like
0,0 through 2,2
therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square.**  The lights all start turned off.**
To defeat your neighbors this year, all you have to do is set up your lights by doing the instructions Santa sent you in order.**
For example: **
turn on 0,0 through 999,999
would turn on (or leave on) every light.**
toggle 0,0 through 999,0
would toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones that were on, and turning on the ones that were off.**
turn off 499,499 through 500,500
would turn off (or leave off) the middle four lights.**
After following the instructions,
how many lights are lit
